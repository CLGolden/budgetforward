# BudgetForward
All budgeting apps will help you figure out the logistics of how to support yourself and your family. The app I want to build does this *and* takes the natural, human ebb and flow of motivation into account. It is based on visualizing hope for oneâ€™s financial future rather than imagining the spectre of dire consequences or feeling the failure of straying from the goal.

To read the whole 'Why' of this project, go to the [article in Medium](https://sunhouseclg.medium.com/why-im-developing-another-budgeting-app-2bd6ec4f6f5d).

I've found only one other, free-standing app like what I want to build, [Balance Forecasting](https://balanceforecastingapp.com). The original developer built it in PHP, then sold it. Now it's clumsy and not working from the graph.

This is to be an open-source project built in JS/React. I'm new to JS/React, running an open-source project and to GitHub. I am pretty good at HTML/CSS.

The way I see it, the app needs to do these things, in this order. It looks to me like the Date Sorting part is going to dictate how the rest works.
